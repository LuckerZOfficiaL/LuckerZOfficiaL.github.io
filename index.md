## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at [GLADIA](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/#about), *Sapienza University of Rome*. My research focuses on overcoming scalability challenges and shortcomings of large models that limit their real-world applicability. Previously, I was an exchange student at the *Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)* and a visiting graduate researcher at *UC San Diego*. 

Outside the lab, I stay active through sports and explore my creativity through [photography](https://unsplash.com/@luca_zh_00) and music, pursuits that keep me energized and refreshed.

Iâ€™m always happy to collaborate, exchange ideas, or just have a chat. Feel free to reach out!
