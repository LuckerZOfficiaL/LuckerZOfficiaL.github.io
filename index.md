## About Me

I am a MSc student at Sapienza University of Rome with a passion for cutting-edge research in deep learning.

I have previously been an exchange student at the *Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)* and I am currently a visiting graduate student at the *University of California San Diego*. 
Feel free to connect for collaborations or just to exchange ideas.
