## About Me

I am an incoming PhD candidate in Computer Science at *Sapienza University of Rome* with a passion for cutting-edge research in deep learning. Specifically, I am focused on addressing scalability limitations of deep learning that hinder its practical application, as well as the weaknesses of current LLMs.  I have previously been an exchange student at the *Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)* and a visiting graduate student researcher at *UC San Diego*. 
Feel free to connect for collaborations or just to exchange ideas.
